<h1 align="center">Nekomata-ui</h1>

**Currently in development**

Nekomata-ui is an UI framework build with Svelte that aims to be a radical new approach for UI frameworks like how Svelte works in comparison to traditional frameworks like React and Vue.

### Nekomata-ui tries to be that by:

* Focusing on the freedom to adapt things to your own needs in the components. (Nekomata-ui takes inspiration from other frameworks and UI designs for its components but does not enforce that the ideas behind it are followed)
* Only using CSS3 without any external library.
