**Currently in development**

Nekomata-ui is an UI framework build with Svelte that aims to be a radical new approach for UI frameworks like how Svelte works in comparison to traditional frameworks like React and Vue.

### Nekomata-ui tries to be that by:

* Focusing on the freedom to adapt things to your own needs in the components. (Nekomata-ui takes inspiration from other frameworks and UI designs for its components but does not enforce that the ideas behind it are followed)
* Only using CSS3 without any external library.
* Going forward instead of looking back. (Implementing new specifications if the browser support is around 80/90% and by not offering support for outdated browsers IE11)

### Climate policy

Nekomata-ui is very concerned about the climate. For this reason, packages that are one year old will be given the deprecated status and then removed from services such as NPM after six months. (Only applicable to services on which nekomata-ui releases were released directly)
