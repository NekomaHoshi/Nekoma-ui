**Currently in development**

Nekomata-ui is an UI framework / component library build with Svelte that focuses on delivering components and features that can be adaptable to your application needs. 

### Nekomata-ui tries to be that by:

* Exporting CSS custom properties (variables) from our components which can be used to alter how they work on the screen.

### Climate policy

Nekomata-ui is very concerned about the climate. For this reason, packages that are one year old will be given the deprecated status and then removed from services such as NPM after six months. (Only applicable to services on which nekomata-ui releases were released directly)
