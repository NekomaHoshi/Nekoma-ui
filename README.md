**Currently in development**

Nekomata-ui is an UI framework / component library build with Svelte that focuses on delivering components and features that can be adaptable to your application needs. 

This framework/library is being build with the idea that you can follow any set of design guidelines/philosophies to reach the design you want for your application. This means there is no enforcement into certain design guidelines/philosophies by Nekomata-ui. 

### Nekomata-ui tries to be that by:

* Exporting CSS custom properties (variables) from our components which can be used to alter how they work on the screen. 
* Components are not build with pre-defined media queries or a dependency to a store with breakpoints. (The aim is to have components with profiles (css classes) that you can alter and set from the outside)

### Contributing

New ideas and improvements are very welcome and will help the framework/library grow. See [contributing](https://github.com/open-anthro-projects/nekomata-ui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) how you can contribute.

### Climate policy

Nekomata-ui is very concerned about the climate. For this reason, packages that are one year old will be given the deprecated status and then removed from services such as NPM after six months. (Only applicable to services on which nekomata-ui releases were released directly)
